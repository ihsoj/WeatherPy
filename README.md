# WeatherPy

## Project Description: 
This project is an analysis of global weather changes in relation to latitude for over 500 random cities. The OpenWeather Rest API and Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook were utilized to (1) perform API calls and (2) create non-duplicate summary statistics. Matplotlib was used to create scatterplots of each relationship.


## Notes:
At https://openweathermap.org/api simply sign up for a free API key.
Once you receive that API key, copy and paste it within the parentheses in the api_keys.py file.
Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Install all the necessary modules to run the code locally.
The results should display as each cell of code runs.
